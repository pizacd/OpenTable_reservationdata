# OpenTable Reservation Data
Plotting OpenTable data to analyze the change in reservations in different cities, states and countries as a result of COVID-19.

This is year-over-year data. As reservations may differ whether it is a weekday or weekend, 3/1/2020 is not being compared to 3/1/2019. Instead, each datapoint is a comparison to the same day of the week the previous year. Example: The number of reservations on Sunday, March 1, 2020 data is being compared to the first Sunday of March in 2019. Positive values indicate an increase in reservations from the previous year, while negative values mean a decrease in reservations. Due to COVID-19, many data are close to -100%, indicating no reservations were made during that particular day.
